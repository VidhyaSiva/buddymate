# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves deploying the BuddyMate senior companion app to AWS infrastructure to make it accessible to end users. The deployment should provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective hosting solution that can handle the needs of senior users accessing the application through web browsers. The deployment must maintain all existing functionality while providing reliable performance and proper security measures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a senior user, I want to access the BuddyMate app through a web browser from any device, so that I can use the companion features without needing to install software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the deployed URL THEN the BuddyMate app SHALL load completely within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the app is accessed from different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) THEN the responsive design SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN users interact with all app features THEN they SHALL function identically to the local development version
4. WHEN multiple users access the app simultaneously THEN performance SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the app deployed on AWS infrastructure, so that it benefits from cloud scalability, reliability, and security features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is deployed THEN it SHALL use AWS services for hosting and content delivery
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the infrastructure SHALL scale automatically to handle demand
3. WHEN users access the app THEN it SHALL be served over HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
4. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN it SHALL include proper monitoring and logging capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated deployment pipeline, so that I can easily update the app and maintain version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the deployment SHALL update automatically
2. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous working version
3. WHEN deployments occur THEN there SHALL be minimal to zero downtime
4. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN they SHALL be possible through simple commands

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want cost-effective hosting, so that the operational expenses remain reasonable for a senior companion app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is deployed THEN it SHALL use cost-optimized AWS services appropriate for the expected traffic
2. WHEN resources are not in use THEN costs SHALL be minimized through proper scaling policies
3. WHEN monitoring the deployment THEN cost tracking SHALL be available and transparent
4. WHEN traffic is low THEN the infrastructure SHALL scale down to reduce costs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious stakeholder, I want the deployment to follow security best practices, so that user data and app functionality are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is deployed THEN all communications SHALL be encrypted using HTTPS
2. WHEN AWS resources are configured THEN they SHALL follow security best practices and least privilege principles
3. WHEN user data is handled THEN it SHALL comply with privacy requirements already built into the app
4. WHEN security updates are needed THEN they SHALL be deployable without service interruption
